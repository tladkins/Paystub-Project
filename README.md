# Vehicle Rental Project
This application is a console based application that demonstrates my skills in Java.  
This application is a basic application intended to be used by a store owner to manage the rentals of cars, bikes, and trailers. 

Using the application: 
1. I recommend using the Eclipse IDE to run this code.
2. Import the folder into Eclipse rather than runing the file from the folder.
4. Once imported, you will also need to create the database using the provided SQL script 'FinalProjectSQL.sql'.
5. Also, you will need to import the four provided .jar files to Eclipse. These are imported by going to Project>Properties>Java Build Path>Add External JARs. 

Other Important Notes:
1. There is an index.html file, this contains the JavaDoc for the project and can be helpful for a quick overview of my project.
2. The main file of the project is 'CVehicleFinal.java'.
3. Since this application accesses the SQL database using the sa account, you will need to input your specific sa password in order for the application to work.
4. Issues with SQL and the TCP/IP address can arise, these can usually be resolved with a quick web search.
